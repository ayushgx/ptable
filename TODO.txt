totally unordered list
base upon the thoughts

!!! GENERALISE THAT MATERIAL MENU

lanthanides,actinides,auperactinides, tags (thinking of a possible way...)

=> IMPROVEMENT: add a little bit of delay when the user hovers the period/group

1) bookmarks fature (then show a snackbar of confirmation)
3) show related topics (in cards style) by tagging created articles with element id or names
4) controls with fixed position just like rounded social share buttons
5) tooltips just like wikipedia... probably with image

OPTIMISATIONS:
 => dynamically add that nuclear icon in the ptable element instead of pushing it in all the elements
