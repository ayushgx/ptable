totally unordered list
base upon the thoughts

!!! GENERALISE THAT MATERIAL MENU
!!! GENERALISE THE THEME COLORING

lanthanides,actinides,auperactinides, tags (thinking of a possible way...)

=> IMPROVEMENT: add a little bit of delay when the user hovers the period/group

1) bookmarks fature (then show a snackbar of confirmation)
3) show related topics (in cards style) by tagging created articles with element id or names
4) controls with fixed position just like rounded social share buttons
5) tooltips just like wikipedia... probably with image
6) create a material design intro like we see in mordern android applications
7) create welcome modal with animated objects bakground (already have)
8) create a context menu just like BeMusic

//other considerations:
if window inner width is > than the width of the periodic table then ptable outer width = window.inner width 

OPTIMISATIONS:
 => dynamically add that nuclear icon in the ptable element instead of pushing it in all the elements
 => FOLLOW THE DELAY PRINCIPLE WHILE ANIMATING THE SEARCH NAV by adding little delay between the animations instead of doing all the animations at the same time...

=====================================//  DONE!!!  //===================================================
ADD 1A2A,... TO THE PERIODS...
