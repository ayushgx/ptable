totally unordered list
base upon the thoughts

!!!!! By including the search-nav data injector, somehow that highlight functionlity has stopped working properly
maybe the fix could be the combination of both injector files...


!!! combine all the data injectors
        => ptable-data-injector.just
        => search-results-data-injector.js

!!! GENERALISE THAT MATERIAL MENU

lanthanides,actinides,auperactinides, tags (thinking of a possible way...)

=> IMPROVEMENT: add a little bit of delay when the user hovers the period/group

1) bookmarks fature (then show a snackbar of confirmation)
3) show related topics (in cards style) by tagging created articles with element id or names
4) controls with fixed position just like rounded social share buttons
5) tooltips just like wikipedia... probably with image



6) a lot of optimisation is required....
